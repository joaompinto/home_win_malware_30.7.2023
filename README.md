# Potential Malware compromise


30.07.2023 discovered potential malware a Home Windows Desktop, related to "maskvpn".
I did not deliberately install this software, and it was  not listed in the "Programs and Features" list.

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -GetFiles

& 'C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe' x "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Support\MpSupportFiles.cab" -oOutput
```
